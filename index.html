    <h1>Essay Grading Criteria</h1>

    <h2>A Grade Criteria</h2>
    <p>1. Topic sentence explicitly states a political stance or argument that goes beyond mere description.</p>
    <p>2. Paragraph has three clearly defined arguments, each tied to a distinct academic source (with page numbers) and followed by the student’s own critical reflection explaining why the point matters.</p>
    <p>3. Writing shows clear political voice—meaning it does not equivocate, but positions itself concretely.</p>
    <p>4. Logical progression ties each argument to the overarching thesis.</p>
    <p>5. Concluding sentence restates the political stance and signals how it leads to the next paragraph.</p>
    <p>6. Includes minimal phrasing or concepts from the weasel word list below.</p>
    <p>7. All items must be present to award A.</p>

    <h2>B Grade Criteria</h2>
    <p>8. Topic sentence identifies a general political perspective but is less forceful (some equivocation or broadness).</p>
    <p>9. Lists major arguments but may be missing either the “why it matters” piece or a fully distinct stance.</p>
    <p>10. Three sources are cited, but at least one citation lacks a page number.</p>
    <p>11. Concluding sentence is broad or vaguely restates the topic without a strong "so what?".</p>
    <p>12. Language is mostly formal but occasionally lapses into description or summary.</p>
    <p>13. Includes some phrasing or concepts from the weasel word list below.</p>
    <p>14. Assign B if at least one A-level requirement is missing but the paragraph remains on-topic and academically focused.</p>

    <h2>C Grade Criteria</h2>
    <p>15. Paragraph is generally relevant, but the political stance is unclear, weak, or lost in description.</p>
    <p>16. Arguments lack sufficient evidence or reflection on why those arguments matter; citations are incomplete (e.g., missing page numbers for multiple sources or unclear attribution).</p>
    <p>17. Sentences are disconnected from a unifying political thesis or remain purely descriptive.</p>
    <p>18. No clear signposts or concluding statement that reiterates a stance.</p>
    <p>19. Includes many of the phrases or concepts from the weasel word list below.</p>
    <p>20. Assign C if the paragraph is missing multiple B-level elements or fails to make a definite claim.</p>

    <h2>D Grade Criteria</h2>
    <p>21. No discernible political stance or significance—fully neutral or purely descriptive.</p>
    <p>22. No coherent structure or progression: it jumps between unrelated points.</p>
    <p>23. No academic citations or citations are extremely vague (e.g., references to “a lecture,” “a textbook,” or missing author names).</p>
    <p>24. Language is informal, relies on clichés, or provides no sense of why the topic matters.</p>
    <p>25. Contains many of the phrases or concepts from the weasel word list below to the extent that it reduces clarity.</p>
    <p>26. Assign D if the paragraph fails to demonstrate any of the A/B/C requirements.</p>

    <p>Sample paragraph for testing: Gender has a significant influence on consumer goods, influencing everything from marketing tactics to product design. As discussed in Chapter 9, the consumer market is deeply gendered, with industries often targeting men and women using rigid and stereotypical frameworks that reinforce binary roles and behaviours. Lesson 9 emphasizes how gendered advertising perpetuates the notion that some things are "naturally" suited to a particular gender, which not only affects purchase decisions but also upholds uneven power dynamics. This is evident in the so-called “pink tax,” where products marketed toward women are often more expensive than comparable items for men, despite no substantive difference in function or quality. As a result, the economy quietly penalizes female customers and monetizes gender inequalities. Furthermore, the visual world is essential; gendered imagery in advertising, which portrays men as strong and logical decision-makers and women as caregivers or beauty-conscious, promotes social norms (McGlinchey, 2022, ch. 9). This marketing ecology influences societal perception and identity formation, as well as customer behaviour. From a normative standpoint, consumer goods should move away from gendered targeting unless functionally justified (e.g., in health products). Instead, industries should prioritize inclusive and diverse representations that reflect a spectrum of identities. By doing this, outmoded conventions are questioned, equity is promoted, and a growingly diverse customer base is better served. Examining how gender is utilized to marginalize and differentiate, as well as imagining what a more inclusive consumer culture might look like, are crucial as we rethink the ethics of marketing and consuming (Lesson 9; McGlinchey, Chapter 9).McGlinchey, S. (2022). Foundations of International Relations. Bloomsbury Publishing. Chapter 9.
